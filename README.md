# What is this?
This is a relatively simple script that automates the installation for Arch Linux for my personal use. While it's tailored for me, you are free to use it as well. Keep in mind that this script currently assumes you have an nvidia gpu. I do not plan to support anything else.

# How to use this script
1. Download the script from my domain (a redirect to the install.sh file) by running: `curl https://arch.icseon.com -o install.sh -L`
2. Make the script executable by running `chmod +x install.sh`
3. Run the script and follow the steps outlined by the prompts by running: `./install.sh`
